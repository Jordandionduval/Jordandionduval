About:

Jordan Dion-Duval is a young artist driven by rigging, animation and technical art. After completing a three year DEC in visual Arts, he developed his critical skills for analyzing art. He also cultivated his technical skills through the completion of multiple game jams and his bachelor in Video Game Creation (Art) at UQAT. Jordan's passion for games is what keeps him creating, from participating in big contests like the Ubisoft Game Lab 2021 and 2022 to working on personal projects just for fun. Simply put, he's a creative artist that works iteratively, that adapts well to critics and that keeps the bigger picture of the project in mind during the production.
